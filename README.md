## Psi method

Code for psychopysical tasks, with particular attention to Psi method and its application with the qCSF\
\
Directories:\
• Jupyter notebook &rarr; Examples for the application of Psi method and bayesian update of parameters\
• Psychopy &rarr; Compared to Matlab Psychtoolbox, not only it's open source, but it's easier to install and more user friendly: one can use both Coder and Builder, the tutorials are much more useful and the help is way more clear\
• Psychtoolbox &rarr; Not only tests, but also scripts for stimuli creation (bandpass filtered letters)\
• Python to Unity &rarr; Dialogue files with Unity for the application of Psi method for different tasks (Slant, SOA)\

## SNN

Directories:\
• Generic tests &rarr;\
• MNIST Numpy (**MISSING HERE**) &rarr;\
• Receptive Fields &rarr;\
• Simulations &rarr;
