# Psychopy

The qCSF method takes the Psi method, which is characterized by a Bayesian approach to the estimation of psychometric curve parameters, and adapts it for the CSF test. The underlying assumption is that the CSF can be represented by a function (log-parabola), whereby the response to each trial will update the entire function, no longer just the threshold value (and slope) relative to a single spatial frequency. By doing so, the number of trials drops exponentially (even from 2000 to only 50) with very high reliability.
